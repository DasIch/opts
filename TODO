TODO

Currently this project is work in progress and there are several things I would
like to implement but haven't until now. Those are:

- Adding commands/options after instantiation of a command.
- Add a help command to every command per default. If we make it an option the
  UI will get inconsistent and difficult to implement.
- Display a helpful message showing alternative options if the given one
  doesn't exist.
