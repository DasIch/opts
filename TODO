TODO
====

Currently this project is work in progress and there are several things I would
like to implement but haven't until now. Those are:

- Adding commands/options after instantiation of a command.
- Add a -h, --help option to every command per default.
- Display a helpful message showing alternative options if the given one
  doesn't exist.
